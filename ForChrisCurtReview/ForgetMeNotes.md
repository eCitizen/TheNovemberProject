* Excerpt from  ["Issues	and	Options	Briefing: Open	Source,	Data	&	Identity"](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/OpenInnovationPolicy/blob/master/ReferenceMaterials/Oct-2013-CIVICS.com-OSS-Briefing-V.0.3.pdf?raw=true):**

Recommendation 4: Provide a Forum for Collaboration

OSS, fundamentally, is premised upon the value of sharing and cooperating with other people. Beyond use of legal instruments such as software licenses, it is important to realize the goals of encouraging reuse, accruing benefits for residents and promoting civic entrepreneurship through venues that enable, catalyze and support long term cooperation on OSS code and projects.

Ultimately, the best way to ensure a vibrant ecology of urban innovation is by fostering self-sustaining communities of contributors. Structuring collaboration among stakeholders within a light-weight, informal but sufficiently clear and structured forum can be accomplished by use of a WordPress Blog. It is recommended that the a blog be launched by the current Administration of the City of Boston for the purpose of providing a resource of this type.

A. Choose a Cool Name for the Blog, Like OpenGovCoop.Org
[In process]

B. Mockup the Blog Using a Live Site and Iterate Collaboratively
Sample Site: http://www.OpenGovCoop.org
[Consider Sub-Domain for Niche Community/Member Sites...]

￼C. Invite 20-30 Trusted, Innovative and Productive Partner to Join the Blog
[Under development]

D. Throw an Online Launch Party for the Blog
[Under development]

E. Use a Monthly Rotation for Hosted Community Salons
[Under development]

F. Have a “Sponsor” for “Tab-Level” Projects
[Under development]

G. Resist Needless Formalization in Favor of Lightweight Goodness
[Under development]

Recommendation 5: Involve Counsel of City of Boston Early & Often

The City of Boston legal counsel's office should be consulted with respect to this discussion and set of recommendations and specifically advice and counsel should be sought regarding the wording and process for a ShareBack clause or other new license or contract provisions. Ideally, the relevant elements of this discussion and recommendations, as amended if appropriate, would be issued in the form of a guidance memo of some kind from the legal counsel.

As an input to further consideration of the legal aspects of OSS licenses and projects, the following references may be of help to stimulate thinking, but they are not intended to be comprehensive or authoritative.
