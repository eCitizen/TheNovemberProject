##The Intent

Purusing the practice of Open Government, favoring participation, transparency, collaboration and engagement with the people of the City and it’s stakeholders; and

Recognizing that information technologies, including web-based and other Internet applications and services, are an essential means for Open Government, and good government generally; and

Desiring to expand and deepen the City’s innovative use of information technology toward the end of good government, including development and use of mobile computing and applications, provision of online data, services and transactions; and

Committing to protect privacy, confidentiality and other requirements and ensuring that protected data not be released in violation of applicable constraints; and

Wanting to share civic technologies that it develops with other municipalities by offering the source code under appropriate open source licensing; and,

Needing to clarify and define open source, open data, privacy, security requirements, interoperability and interaction flows, necessary for the City’s Open Government agenda;

Now therefore, the City of Boston Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), in consultation with City departments, is issuing this Open Innovation Policy.
