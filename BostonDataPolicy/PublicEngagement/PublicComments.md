# Open [a][b] Data Policy

## About the Policy

This policy is in effect under Executive Order of Mayor Martin J. Walsh: “An Order Relative to Open Data and Protected Data Sharing [c] ,” issued April 7, 2014.  

## Open Data Manager

The Open Data Manager [d][e] of the City of Boston is responsible for publication of Open Data Sets in accordance with this Policy. The Open Data Manager shall identify [g] Open Data [h] of or held by the City of Boston and facilitate the preparation, loading, approval and publication of said data through the data. CityofBoston [i] open data portal.

### Standards and Formats

The Open Data Manager  shall use the open data portal and other sites or services as appropriate to publish and maintain guidance to City Departments and other stakeholders describing the relevant standards and formats used to structure and access data sets on the open data portal.  

### Interoperability and Access

To the extent practicable, the Open Data Manager shall also facilitate collaborative efforts of multiple governmental jurisdictions and public sector entities to pool, regionalize or otherwise coordinate the publication, accessibility and interoperability of Open Data.

## City Departments

Leadership and personnel of City Departments shall work with the Open Data Manager [j] to publish all data that are public record unless a public policy, security, liability or other material objection exists. Data shall be published as soon as practicable and in order of priority based upon relevant considerations [k].

## Staging and Phasing Publication of Open Data

The City of Boston Corporation Counsel shall be notified as soon as practicable when the Open Data Manager and a City Department agree upon data to be published.

## Legal and Regulatory Approvals and Continuing Compliance

The Corporation Counsel is responsible for determining whether publication of data is legally permitted or prohibited.  

### Modifications to, Stipulations on or Revocations of Approvals

The Corporation Counsel may approve publication of data subject to stipulations. Material change in the data [l] or other change in circumstances that impacts the basis upon which approval was provided may result in modification of approvals by the Corporation Counsel, including but not limited to the addition of stipulations, the prohibition against publication of some of the data or otherwise.

### Open Data manifest

The Open Data Manager shall maintain a running manifest [m][n][o][p][q] of all data published, stipulations applicable to such data, if any, and other data that is in the process of preparation for approval and publication, or that has been prohibited to be published, and shall publish the contents of said manifest for internal access by authorized personnel of the City of Boston. The Open Data Manager shall also include the contact information of relevant data owners, data custodians or other data stewards with operational, programmatic or other lead responsibility for the data published.

## Controlled Data Policy

The CIO and the Corporation Counsel will develop a Controlled Data Policy that complies with Federal, Commonwealth, and local laws regarding privacy, confidentiality and security of data.  This policy is intended to cover authorized access to and/or required disclosure of data that is subject to a legal restriction, protection or other control that prevents its open, public distribution.   The City’s development and implementation of a Controlled Data Policy will be deliberate and measured to ensure protection against data breaches and improper disclosures of sensitive data [r]. Where appropriate, initial controlled data sharing will be on a pilot basis before implementation of a comprehensive data sharing agreement.

Open the Stenograph Record of Public Meetings of Boston City Council for hard of hearing folks ! The .sgstn StenoGraph StenoNote file released needs the additional file not yet released to interpret the .sgstn

#### [b] 11:11 AM Apr 10, 2014
This isn't a comment about the policy, but about a specific data set. Perhaps it would be a good idea to include a clause somewhere about accessibility of the data, though I know the City ensures their web services are accessible.

#### [c] 10:18 PM Apr 29
For those wanting to read it: http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=6589

#### [d] 8:51 PM Apr 8, 2014
I would like to take a moment to commend and thank Curt Savoie for his ongoing work to open data in the City of Boston. He has been an excellent resource and ally to us at Code for Boston.

#### [e] 9:23 PM Apr 15, 2014
Much agreed!

#### [f] 8:46 PM Apr 8, 2014
"responsible for publication" > What enforcement authority does the Open Data Manager have in opening these datasets? If someone is resistant to opening public data, what is the resolution process?

#### [g] 8:57 PM May 27
It'd be great to somewhat specify how they will be identified: "including but not limited to" community interest

Beyond low-hanging-fruit datasets that are easy to publish, it would be great to prioritize based on civic or business intentions for using data. It might make sense to add some language about collecting or soliciting interests, e.g. a web form/button on the data portal to request releases.

#### [h] 8:47 PM Apr 8, 2014
"shall identify Open Data" > This implies the data is already open. I might reword to "openable data" or "public data yet to be opened", or something with that spirit.

#### [i] 8:46 PM Apr 8, 2014
data.cityofboston.gov

#### [j] 8:57 PM May 27
It'd be great to specifically require the Open Data Manager to work with the Procurement Office/Chief Procurement Officer to develop (where appropriate) contract provisions that promote open data policies. Chicago and San Francisco have requirements to that effect in their open data policies.

#### [k] 9:49 PM May 1
What are the relevant considerations for prioritization? I think there should be a process for the community to request data and be able to weigh in on priorities.

#### [l] 10:41 PM Apr 29
As it reads now, Corporation Counsel can modify approval if there is change, but there is no mechanism to inform them of changes. Understanding re-approval would not be a big deal often, would it be prudent to add a mechanism that informs them of substantial changes, such as the addition of certain fields of new information?

#### [m] 11:13 AM Apr 9, 2014
Is it possible to publish an abridged version of this manifest publicly as well? It'd be good to know if data that I want made open has already been reviewed and been prohibited rather than making requests that get turned down repeatedly by multiple members of the public because nobody knows what's been reviewed already or not.

#### [n] 11:09 AM Apr 10, 2014
All of the currently opened data is available at data.cityofboston.gov.

#### [o] 11:23 AM Apr 10, 2014
Understood. My concern is for the rest of the manifest. Which data is "prohibited to be published", for example? The website won't tell me that.

#### [p] 11:45 AM Apr 10, 2014
A possible idea is to publish a list of data in the pipeline as well as a list of requests. Not sure what that would look like yet, but it may be a way for us to be clear about the process and prevent duplicate requests as well as inform about the decisions regarding publishing or not.

#### [q] 9:16 PM May 27
According to the executive order, this policy may guide "classification of their [departments'] data sets as public or protected and a method to report such classification to the CIO." If opened, this list which could outline for people the "prohibited to be published"/protected datasets. 

I second the idea that a summary what is protected could be useful, at least as a map of what data the City holds.

#### [r] 8:50 PM Apr 8, 2014
I want to encourage the development of a Controlled Data Policy that supports the anonymization and summarization of data. For example, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council released anonymous, aggregated vehicle inspection records (the MA Vehicle Census) that prevented identification of individuals through the data. Data was summarized to zip code areas and grid cells; individual records were not released, avoiding the pitfalls mentioned here: http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/09/your-secrets-live-online-in-databases-of-ruin/.
