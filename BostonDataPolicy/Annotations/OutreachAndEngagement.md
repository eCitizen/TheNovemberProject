# Example Workflow & Outreach Plan

The following example contemplated the potential publishing of city laws as open data and illustrates how a business case could be articulated for priority publishing status. The example also demonstrates how a plan can be developed to identify and engage relevant stakeholders communities who do or would regularly access, rely upon and contribute important value to the data either directly or through innovative apps, services and other productive uses of the data.

**City of Boston Laws as an Open Data Set**

Steps Required to Publish City Ordinances as Open Data

Evidently, this will be simple, free and fast thanks to the preliminary work by Curt and Jose. All that is required is for somebody at City Hall (Jose or Curt would be fine) to signal interest to either American Legal (the publisher) or the OpenGov Foundation and from that moment the two organizations work together to parse the current files into open data (including plain text with no markup, an XML version and a JSON version).

The publisher and OpenGov Foundation published the following press release with details on this offer to transition the law of any jurisdiction of the publisher into open data, including the contact information to indicate a desire to move forward: http://americadecoded.org/announcing-the-amlegal-decoder-a-free-tool-to-publish-laws-seamlessly-online-in-ridiculously-useful-open-data-formats/

The resulting data can be loaded by Curt in bulk form into Socrata. Since the City Council amends these laws form time to time, the Socrata should be refreshed periodically. The City can load updated files directly from the authoritative publishing source as often as the City deems appropriate.

Benefits of Making Laws Open Data Using Publisher’s Plan

Two significant benefits of the arrangement between American Legal and OpenGov Foundation are:

1) OpenGov Foundation is part of a growing leadership group of cities and states who are following this course and in order to encourage Boston to step forward, the foundation has agreed to take responsibility for whatever parsing, formatting and testing is needed to transition the current files into non-proprietary open data formats and structures. Other cities who follow this path would need to find a way to accomplish this task (eg by dedicating internal technical staff, managing volunteers or perhaps hiring a developer for perhaps a few hundred or thousand dollars depending upon the level of complexity of their legal corpus); and

2) The OpenGov Foundation currently and for the foreseeable future hosts a REST service with documented API for developers to create great apps and services using any corpus of law that has been parsed into open data in XML and JSON formats. The collaboration between American Legal and the OpenGov Foundation means that the City of Boston laws would also be available at no charge to the City .or to users as a REST service that is common to a growing number of jurisdictions.

Common Legal API/Data Structure Governance

- Problems and Prospects

Use of a widely used API and data structure can amplify the reach of innovation and provide significant value. However, eventual reliance upon can also be risky if or when the needs of the City of Boston’s and the capabilities of the common standard grow apart (due to changes with either or both).

- Summary and Action

To address this risk and amplify the potential value, the City of Boston can join a governance group set up to develop a common approach and steer forward evolution. As a founding member, with SF, NYC, Chicago and DC, Boston would have an influential role in a very collegial group that is poised to grow quickly as many jurisdictions accept the offer to publish open data versions of law.

- Background and Context

While having the laws loaded on Socrata as open data in bulk form is very important, the deeper value is having the data expressed as a service that can be integrated with other services and apps. Using the API and data structures can be fraught if or when those standards fail to reflect business needs of user communities that may increasingly rely upon access to the data as a liquid service rather than a bulk download.

Dazza has worked with the group advancing the API and data structures to directly address this strategic and operational risk. A unique and valuable aspect of the arrangement between American Legal and the OpenGov Foundation is a city-led steering group that leads the effort to bring laws online using a common approach. The group is called the FreeLawFive and is intended to launch in a public announcement within the next few months. By ensuring cities themselves have a steering role on developing and evolving the API and data structures, the non-profit advocates and legal publishers can promote alignment and harmonization on a common approach over time and reduce their own risk of providing a REST service that is unsuitable. The approach also creates adaptive mechanisms for any jurisdiction.

Curt participated in the last meeting of this group so as to become acquainted with it and to provide a general overview of how the City of Boston open data processes work. After Curt’s introduction to the group, the City of Boston was invited by unanimous vote of the group to be one of the founding jurisdictions. The other four jurisdictions are San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Washington, DC. By accepting this invitation, Curt or another designee of the City would be welcome (but not required) to join twice monthly direction setting calls of a leadership group steers this initiative called “The FreeLawFive.”

This small founding group is chaired by rotating designees of the participating cities and facilitated during it’s startup phase by Dazza Greenwood in his capacity as head of the MIT Media Lab Legal Physics research team and Seamus Kraft, who heads the OpenGov Foundation. Participation, even on a relatively passive basis, in this group would provide Boston access to learn first of the most innovative practices and uses of open legal data for constituents and other stakeholders around the country. The City of Boston a top governance position to communicate and even vote upon changes to the America Decoded API and data structures by virtue of it’s seat on the FreeLawFive.

Purpose of Publishing and Priority or Value:

The purpose of publishing the City Law as open data is because it is public data and people are responsible to know the law and entitled to have access to it. Th elaw is also a valuable data set that is of high importance to many city departments and constituencies of the city.

Description and Classification of the Data Set:

The data is currently published by American Legal in a process that introduces many proprietary elements of content and tags and other meta data into the files. The publisher has offered, in partnership with the OpenGov Foundations, to strip all proprietary information from the laws both as a one time transition of the entire corpus and also to maintain the data set for the foreseeable future as open data.

The data, notwithstanding the proprietary information introduced by the publisher, appears to be public records under Massachusetts law and as such does not appear to be subject to any prohibition, restriction or other constraint on publishing as open free data by the City of Boston.

This data is classified as open data.

Review and Approval:

* Date of Approval by Corporate Counsel:
* Date of Approval by CIO:
* Date of Acceptance into Pipeline by Curt:

Background: The contract obligations with the publisher appear to be handled by the City Corporate Counsel, who has requested clarification in writing from the publisher that publishing this legal data is acceptable. The publisher has requested the opportunity to work with the City of Boston the refine and accelerate the process of transitioning the current data into open data. Once the City of Boston signals its desire to have the data published as open data the process of creating and providing the open data can begin.

Publishing Plan:

- Extract, Transform and Load plan (to be developed by Curt)

- Data Formats, Structures and Other Protocols (to be developed by Curt)

- Stakeholder Outreach and Engagement:

(the following is an example of how a publishing plan can include engagement of interested stakeholders to make the most of the data).

The Boston Bar Association, Massachusetts Bar Association and American Bar Association, to name only a few, each have important sections, committees, task forces and other interest groups that will have significant demand for and motivation to use this data. Some of the members and affiliates of these bar associations will also be likely hotbeds of innovative use of the data, development of apps or service integrations and provide a force-multiplier effect bringing the value of open law to the populations and economic sectors they serve and represent.

A sufficient minimal step to inform and engage these stakeholders would be emailing an announcement and link to download the data to the Executive Director of each bar association inviting them to forward the email to committees and individuals who would be interested in learning more about this data set and REST service. Greater results could be yielded with personal outreach to thought leaders and other relevant active members of bar associations to preview the data before a public announcement and to convene a demo, write a blog post, host a hackathon, publish a data or innovation challenge, etc.

The laws of a city are a deep expression of it’s sovereign and independent governance and decision making. As such, the City of Boston itself is a key user community of this data set. Outreach to departments and other municipal entities will likely reveal demand for and quick adoption of free access to relevant city laws. In addition to outreach aimed at organizational units, functional communities of users responsible for regulatory compliance, human resources, accounting and finance, paralegal or other cross-cutting employees and contractors of the city. As with many other open data sets, the city itself will soon depend upon and find great value from direct and free access to this data.

- Promoting Beneficial Use and Catalyzing Innovation:

Getting the Word Out: Publishing a page on an open data blog with links to or descriptions of interesting, important and/or innovative use of this type of data would provide a sound basis to inform and spark valuable and creative downstream application of the City Ordinances in bulk form and as REST accessible services.

Leveraging the Local Innovation Machine: Participation in the MIT Legal Hackathon would provide a quick-start to gather best practices, examples of practical wins and evocative case studies from other jurisdictions, user communities and experts. Better yet, the City of Boston could pose an innovation challenge for participants in the hackathon to develop creative ways to work with this data. The Legal Hackathon has a simple method for partners to propose a “Data Challenge” and to invite design concepts or prototypes. The current challenges are scheduled to last for two weeks, to provide ample time for teams or individuals to refine a great proposal and presentation. Criteria for such a challenge could be to present a project that would result with a deep impact, wide scale and/or high value by use of the City of Boston open legal data. A challenge could solicit simple use cases and a conceptual design and/or a working prototype of an app or service. A challenge could focus on data science (eg using statistical modeling or predictive analytics or other data science methods and techniques on or with the data) or on interoperation of some business practice, legal procedure or technical process using the data in some way. Teams or individuals submit responses to a data challenge using a form on LegalHackathon.org and some days later, each make a live presentation of their demo, pitch and Q&A with the people who posed the challenge.

The resulting YouTube videos of the final presentations and discussion, along with Creative Commons and open source licensed contributions (prototypes, slide decks, statistical models, visualizations, etc) are available as free, open resources in the Legal Hackathon GitHub repositories and accessible on a thumbnail gallery on the LegalHackathon.org blog. These artifacts are designed for stakeholders to use on their blogs to get the word out even further and for catalyzing subsequent and perhaps larger scale cycles of innovations. The City of Boston could use such artifacts to inform, engage and stimulate relevant stakeholders to access, use and build with municipal law data.
