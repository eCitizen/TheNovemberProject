About Data Classification:

As a key strategic and valuable asset of the City of Boston, basic documentation and management is necessary for both Open Data and Protected Data.  The most important documentation factor is whether data is classified as Public Record or Exempt Record.  Classification of data as Public Records or as Exempt Records under Massachusetts Public Records law and regulation determines what rules and processes apply to publishing or otherwise sharing the data.  Data classified with the status Public Record may be freely published and shared subject to the City of Boston Open Data Policy.  Data classified with the status Exempt Record is subject to the City of Boston Protected Data Policy and may be subject to additional security and legal requirements, constraints or other stipulations.
