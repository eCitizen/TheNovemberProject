<hr>

<strong> Files Displaying the  <a href="http://openinnovationframework.net/DataClassification/Exempt-ProtectedData-DeliberativeProcess.html">Linked Notice: "Non-Public Record of Ongoing Deliberative Draft Policy Development" </a> are Part of an Ongoing Deliberative Policy Development Process and Therefore are Not Considered Public Records.  Final Policy Resulting From This Process Will Be Public Record.</strong>

<p>

Massachusetts Public Records Law exemption (d) (also known as the "Deliberative Process Exemption") provides a limited executive privilege for policy development. It applies to: inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters relating to policy positions being developed by the agency; but this subclause shall not apply to reasonably completed factual studies or reports on which the development of such policy positions has been or may be based.

<p>

The exemption is intended to avoid release of materials that could taint the deliberative process if prematurely disclosed. Its application is limited to recommendations on legal and policy matters found within an ongoing deliberative process.65 Factual reports which are reasonably complete and inferences which can be drawn from factual investigations, even if labeled as opinions or conclusions, are not exempt as deliberative or policy making materials. Only portions of records that possess a deliberative or policymaking character and relate to an ongoing deliberative process are exempt from mandatory disclosure.
