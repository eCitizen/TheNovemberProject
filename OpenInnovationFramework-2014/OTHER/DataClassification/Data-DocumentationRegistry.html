Upon the publication each set of Open Data, if reasonably possible, the following additional information should also be included in, linked from or logically associated with the Open Data Manifest entry for the dataset: 

● Data Dictionary and other metadata detailing fields, data types, and publishing information (see Technical Standards Manual)
● Any source code that can be made open source, is relevant and has public value;
● Links to systems (ie: apps, services, platforms, etc) that integrate or otherwise use the dataset, with a short description of the relevant context.  Descriptions accompanying links to implementations of Open Data should identify:
 - Why and how the data is used by or with the system;
 - What value the dataset adds to the system and/or what value the system implementation adds to the dataset;
 - Contact information for implementers of the system or other citations or links to learn more about the system.

Further reviews, community input or department needs may necessitate making changes to a currently published dataset. These can include the adding or subtracting of fields, filtering of specific content or removal of a dataset completely. The same review process will allow for these changes and require updated documentation and approvals where appropriate.
