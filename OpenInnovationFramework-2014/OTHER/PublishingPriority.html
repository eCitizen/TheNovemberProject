# Relevant Considerations:

When determinng whether or when a data set should be publshed to the public the following considerations must be taken into account:

## Volume: 
The data is of a type that is of significant size and continually provided and/or of very large size and periodically provided;

### Velocity: 
Rapid access to the data is important and rendering the data accessible through data.cityofboston.gov is the most effective, least expensive or otherwise highest value method to enable immediate access to the data;

## Variability: 
The data fluctuates at a high rate and access to the then-current state of the data is of value;

## Variety: 
The addition of the data, when used in combination with other data sets, affords enhanced compound value;

## Validity: 
The data sheds light upon the legitimacy of government or the acts of government, such as ethics disclosures and violations, or the conduct of elections and responses to election fraud or other violations;

## Veracity: 
The data provides verifiable metrics from an authoritative public source, such as weights and measurements, census and vital statistics, reported crime, public health, or other data sets for which accurate readings are required to correctly calibrate or determine responses by sensitive, mission critical, high risk or high value systems.

## Value: 
Rendering the data accessible via data.cityofboston.gov is in the public interest and/or yields other material sources of value to government, the private sector, a definable subset of a sector and/or the public at large.
